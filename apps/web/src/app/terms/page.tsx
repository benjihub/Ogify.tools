          <Section title="1. About Ogify">
            <p>
              Ogify ("we", "us", "our") is a service that provides an API for
              generating social share images (Open Graph images) and website
              screenshots. The service is operated by Ogify ("Company"). By
              accessing or using the Ogify API and website (the "Service"), you
              agree to these Terms of Service ("Terms").
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section title="2. Accounts & API Keys">
            <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
              <li>You must provide a valid email address to create an account.</li>
              <li>
                You are responsible for keeping your API keys secret. Any activity
                performed using your API key is your responsibility.
              </li>
              <li>
                You must not share your account, API keys, or use the Service in a
                way that exceeds reasonable usage limits defined in your plan.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </Section>

          <Section title="3. Payments & Billing">
            <p>
              Ogify uses Paddle as its Merchant of Record. Paddle handles all
              payment processing, tax collection, and remittance.
            </p>
            <p>
              By purchasing a paid plan, you agree to Paddle&apos;s terms and the
              price displayed at checkout.
            </p>
            <p>
              Subscription plans renew automatically until cancelled. You can
              cancel anytime via the Paddle-provided customer portal.
            </p>
            <p>Refunds are at our discretion. If you have issues, contact us first.</p>
          </Section>

          <Section title="4. Acceptable Use">
            <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
              <li>Generate images for illegal, harmful, abusive, or fraudulent content.</li>
              <li>Attempt to overload, DDoS, or circumvent rate limits.</li>
              <li>
                Resell the raw API without meaningful value-add (white-label use is
                allowed under a white-label plan).
              </li>
              <li>Violate any applicable laws.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate
              these rules.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section title="5. Intellectual Property">
            <p>
              You retain all rights to the content you submit (titles, images,
              URLs) and the generated images produced via our API.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ogify retains all rights to the underlying API code, templates, and
              infrastructure.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you use a free plan, generated images may contain a
              &quot;Powered by Ogify&quot; watermark. Paid plans remove this watermark;
              white-label plans allow your own branding.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
              We are not liable for any loss of data, revenue, or business from
              your use of the Service.
